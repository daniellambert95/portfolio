With a broad array of interests and a diverse skill set I will quickly adapt to any area of business. I am versatile, reliable and forward thinking, with the proven ability to upskill and adapt rapidly.

From a very young age I showed great interest in computers and tech by ordering the parts to build my very own computer. I then proceeded to get to grips with a variety of software that brought me on the creative journey to where I am now. Some of my advanced skills include Python, Django and SQL. I also have some good knowledge in UI/UX development, logo and graphic design, HTML and CSS.

Although the path and my journey has been long, I believe I am only getting started and I have a number of projects that I would like to create while continuously learning along the way. Next, I want to better my knowledge of JavaScript and become well equipped with the React framework in order to transition from back-end to a full-stack developer.
